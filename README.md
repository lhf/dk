# A vertex-centric representation for adaptive diamond-kite meshes

This is the code accompanying the paper "A vertex-centric representation for adaptive diamond-kite meshes" submitted for publication.

Adaptive diamond-kite meshes were introduced in the paper [Diamond-kite adaptive quadrilateral meshing](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-013-0327-9) by Eppstein (2014).

Running `make` outputs a sample adaptive diamond-kite mesh in four formats: eps, csv, off, obj. The eps file is converted to pdf using pstopdf.

The code should work in both Python 2 and Python 3.
